### PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

A **transformation sequence** from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words `beginWord -> s_1 -> s_2 -> ... -> s_k` such that:

	- Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.

	- Every `s_i` for `1 <= i <= k` is in `wordList`. Note that `beginWord` does not need to be in `wordList`.

	- `s_k == endWord`

Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return *the **number of words** in the **shortest transformation sequence** from* `beginWord` *to* `endWord`*, or *`0`* if no such sequence exists.*

 

**Example 1:**

```

**Input:** beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
**Output:** 5
**Explanation:** One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.

```

**Example 2:**

```

**Input:** beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
**Output:** 0
**Explanation:** The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.

```

 

**Constraints:**

	- `1 <= beginWord.length <= 10`

	- `endWord.length == beginWord.length`

	- `1 <= wordList.length <= 5000`

	- `wordList[i].length == beginWord.length`

	- `beginWord`, `endWord`, and `wordList[i]` consist of lowercase English letters.

	- `beginWord != endWord`

	- All the words in `wordList` are **unique**.
